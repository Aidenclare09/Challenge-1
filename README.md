## Description 
Throughout this project many changes were made to the existing
codebase, in order for the website to meet accessibility standards 
and sothat the Horiseon site is optimized for search engine optimization.
In order for this to be acomplished, the features of the codebase
needed to be improved. Upon completion, there are semantic HTML elements,
the elements follow a logical structure, there are accessible alt attributes, 
the heading attributes are in sequential order and the title element is concice 
and descriptive.
